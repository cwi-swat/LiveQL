LiveQL
====================

QL is a simple DSL for questionnaires. For more information on the
language, see the assignment for the
[Language Workbench Challenge 2013](http://www.languageworkbenches.net/images/5/53/Ql.pdf).

This Eclipse project contains a "Live" version of this language. You
can edit QL programs while the questionnaire is "running". 

The class `nl.cwi.swat.liveql.render.App` can be run with a single
argument which represents a path to a QL file (see under
`nl.cwi.swat.liveql.examples` for examples). NB: currently this path
should be relative to the classpath of the project.
